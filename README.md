##### Such [reader](docs/0.8/screen-1.jpg), very [manga](docs/0.8/screen-2.jpg)!

## Why?
> “I don't want to waste my time while scans are loading, just as I don't need to see adds aside to the content I came to read.“ - Malo Blanchard

## Usage

# clone
git clone https://github.com/Izin/manga-scraper.git
